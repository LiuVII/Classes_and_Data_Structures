<- Color ----------------------------------------------------------------------
This Class will allows to represent colors and perform a few simple operations
on their components.


The Color Class have three public integer attributes:
-> $red;
-> $green;
-> $blue;
that represent the components of a color which represent a color instance.

An instance can be contructed from either a RGB value:
new Color( array( 'rgb' => 'a31bc5') );

Or from distinct red, green, blue components:
new Color( array( 'red' => 120, 'green' => 85, 'blue' => 180 ) );

All distinct values and RGB value are converted to intergers.
No checks and restrictions on values are made.


The class provides the following methods:

Color   add( Color $rgb );
Adds each color component and returns a new Color instance.

Color   sub( Color $rgb );
Substracts each color component and returns a new Color instance.

Color   mult( $num );
Multiplies each color component by factor $num and returns a new Color
instance.


Class also contains Boolean static attribute
-> verbose;
With default state False, which controls the display of information related
to the use of the Class.

Example:

Input:
	Color::$verbose = True;
	$red = new Color( array( 'red' => 0xff, 'green' => 0, 'blue' => 0 ) );

Output:
	Color( red: 255, green:   0, blue:   0 ) constructed.
